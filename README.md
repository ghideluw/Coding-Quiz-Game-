Build a quiz application using Javascript

This project aims to create a quiz application that will run on a browser. The quiz will be built using javascript code for fucntionality and implement 
CSS and HTML code to be able to provide a user interface that is interactive and dynamic. The quiz will appear as a series of prompted multiple choice questions
and the questions will be timed to test users knowledge. The application will apply theory from the course around selecting DOM elements and applying Javascript code
to interact with those elements to be able to allow the user to engage with the application and progress through the game. Certain elements like click events, event listeners,
and use of local storage to store and retrieve information like user and score will be worked through in the application code.
